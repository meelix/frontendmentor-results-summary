## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS native nesting
- CSS color-mix
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

css color-mix

this sets the background to be red with a 5% opacity on a white background while still being a solid color.
so basicaly it precomputes transparent colors without actually being transparent.

```css
.someclass {
  background-color: color-mix(in srgb, red 5%, white);
}
```
